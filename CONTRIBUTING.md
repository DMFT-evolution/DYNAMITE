# Contributing to DYNAMITE

We welcome contributions! Please:

1) Discuss large changes first in an issue.
2) Keep PRs focused and include a short test run evidence.
3) Update documentation under `docs/` as needed.

- Style: C++17, consistent formatting, Doxygen for public APIs
- Build: CMake; prefer portable configurations for CI
- Docs: run `./docs/gen_api.sh` if you touch public headers

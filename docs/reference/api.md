# API Reference

The full API reference is generated from Doxygen XML via `docs/gen_api.sh`. Run the helper script to rebuild the latest pages:

```bash
./docs/gen_api.sh
```

During local previews without Doxygen, this placeholder keeps navigation intact. When the script is executed, Doxybook2 will populate `docs/reference/api/` with the rich API documentation that MkDocs publishes.
